---

## Introduction
Personal attempt on the StudentScorePrediction question from AIAP

## Prerequsities
Refer to prerequsities.txt for required Python libraries <br>

## Overview
### Task 1
Use Jupyter notebook (eda.ipynb) to do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided SQL database (score.db) <br> <br>
Requirements:
- Use SQLite or similar to open and read the SQL database
- Clean up and process data to produce some form of correlation between students' results and the other datasets

### Task 2
Use Python scripts (*.py) to create an End-to-End Machine Learning pipeline <br> <br>
Requirements:
- Appropriate data processing and feature engineering
- Appropriate use and optimization of at least 3 algorithms/models
- Appropriate explanation for choice of algorithms/models
- Appropriate use of evaluation metrics
- Appropriate explanantion of evaluation metrics
